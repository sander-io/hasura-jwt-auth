# Hasura-PGJWT Quickstart

Intent is to allow for a quick and simple production-ready boilerplate from the Hasura PGJWT scripts, with an initial schema defined as code in the SQL files here.

Steps: 

1. (Optional) Change the .env file parameters to something secure
2. Run `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate` to start with the enviroment defaults. 
3. Connect to http://localhost:5050 for PGAdmin interface, and http://localhost:8080 for Hasura.
